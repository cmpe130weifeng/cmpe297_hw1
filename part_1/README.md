GitHub Copilot is an AI tool that provides you code suggestions based on comments and the context of the file you're editing.<br />
As image shown, the AI can generate codes for you based on comments you make. <br />

I have test it for three the examples: tf.keras, pytorch, and linear regression. <br />
  1. tf.keras: I tried a basic CNN model on the mnist dataset. In this assignment, the key is to get familiar with the tool Copilot. Capliot is so powerful that, it provided me with a template of codes so that I can easily use them. I only ran 1 epoch. The result of loss is: 0.0186; and the accuracy is: 0.9942. If you increase epochs, you can see the curve line in graphs. <br />
  2. pytorch: I also tried a basic CNN model on the mnist handwriting dataset with pytorch. The accuracy of the model on the 10000 test images: 98 %. If you increase epochs, it could increase performance. <br />
  3. test on a linear regression model: At the end, I tried Copilot with a linear regression model and some other pratices. Overall, Gopilot a very powerful tool for AI pair programming. It help us to reduce programming time and bugs. <br />
  
All the progresses is shown in the video. <br />
